When the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! Starting around Season 5, the show took a different focus - still good, but different.<br /><br />The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the \"Stargate\". The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie \"Stargate\" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt.<br /><br />The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. What happens next was always unpredictable.<br /><br />The characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. Their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. They are simply fun to watch.<br /><br />Starting somewhere around Season 5, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature.<br /><br />One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. They are simply can't-miss shows. They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 Seasons and you'll likely be hooked.

        "output": "To find all rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$, we will use the method of descent, which is based on the group law for elliptic curves.\n\nFirst, we find an initial rational point on the curve. By inspection, we can see that $(x, y) = (-1, 1)$ is a rational point on the curve, since $1^2 = (-1)^3 + 5(-1) + 7$.\n\nNow, we will use the group law for elliptic curves to find other rational points. Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, the sum $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is also a point on the curve, and its coordinates can be computed as follows:\n\n1. If $P = O$ (the point at infinity), then $P + Q = Q$.\n2. If $Q = O$, then $P + Q = P$.\n3. If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $P + Q = O$.\n4. If $P = Q$, then $x_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}$ and $y_3 = \\frac{-(2x_1^3 + ax_1 + b) + x_1^2}{2y_1}$, where $a = 5$ and $b = 7$ in our case.\n5. If $P \\neq Q$, then $x_3 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ and $y_3 = \\frac{-(x_2^3 + ax_2 + b) + x_1(x_2 - x_1)}{y_2 - y_1}$.\n\nWe will use these formulas to find other rational points on the curve, starting with the point $(-1, 1)$.\n\n1. Doubling the point $(-1, 1)$, we get $2(-1, 1) = (0, -2)$.\n2. Adding the points $(-1, 1)$ and $(0, -2)$, we get $(-1, 1) + (0, -2) = (3, 5)$.\n3. Doubling the point $(3, 5)$, we get $2(3, 5) = (20/9, -161/27)$.\n4. Adding the points $(-1, 1)$ and $(20/9, -161/27)$, we get $(-1, 1) + (20/9, -161/27) = (36/25, 587/125)$.\n\nWe can continue this process to find more rational points on the curve. However, there is no general formula to find all rational points on an elliptic curve, and the method of descent can be quite involved. In practice, computer algorithms are used to find rational points on elliptic curves.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found several rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$, including $(-1, 1)$, $(0, -2)$, $(3, 5)$, $(20/9, -161/27)$, and $(36/25, 587/125)$. There are likely many more rational points on the curve, but finding them all is beyond the scope of this answer."

It also implies that holomorphic functions have antiderivatives, and their integrals are path-independent in simply connected domains.\n\nCauchy's Integral Theorem is a powerful tool in complex analysis, as it allows us to evaluate contour integrals and study the properties of holomorphic functions in a more profound way.",

It is important to note that the \"best\" smartphone may vary depending on an individual's preferences and usage patterns. However, we can identify some popular smartphones that offer great value for money within this price range, so as to provide you with an informed perspective on this matter.\n\nHere are some top smartphone options under Rs 15,000 in India:\n\n1.

This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \"Queen Mab Scherzo\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \"Resurrection\", the vocal fourth movement, \"Urlicht\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \"The Gothic\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum., can you guess it ?\nThe answer to this question is:",

Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions.

The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle.

Like the Grignard reaction, the Barbier reaction results in the formation of an alkoxide ion, which can subsequently be protonated to produce the corresponding alcohol.\n\nIn summary, the Barbier reaction is used to produce organozinc compounds, which can further react with carbonyl compounds to generate alkoxide ions and ultimately alcohols upon protonation."

My best friend (let's call him James) was one of the only people I still considered a friend, alongside my crush (let's call her Mia) and a few others. Me, James, Mia and her close friend were all particularly good friends.\n\n That was up until James started being a dick to Mia. This caused her to walk off to the bathroom in an emotional state with our other friend on multiple occasions, whilst James and his other friends walked off laughing. This often times left me alone at the table we usually sat at for lunch. Mia properly just cut James out.\n\nThis left me in the middle, which was shitty because both sides really hated each other. Suddenly, my best friend and his new friends start being twats towards me aswell. So, I decided I'd follow Mia and just cut him out. But I soon realised that I now had next to no friends. This was as Mia and her other friend thought I was still friends with James. Therefore, I am no closer to getting with my crush, and even lonlier. How can I get Mia to understand that I want nothing to do with James, and how can I then get closer to her?",

Great quality, sturdy and does a perfect job mashing potatos and also turnips. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?\nA:",
        "output": "The given product review depicts the Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher in a predominantly flattering light, emphasizing its various positive aspects. The review from the customer clearly expresses their satisfaction with the product, highlighting its great quality, sturdiness, and ability to effectively mash potatoes and turnips. These features indicate that the Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher outperforms their previous potato masher, which was rusting and possibly of lower quality.\n\nThe review begins by discussing the main reason for the customer's purchase - their old potato masher had begun to rust. Rusting, as a negative attribute, creates an implied contrast between the old masher and the newly acquired Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher. The reviewer then proceeds to praise the new product for three positive attributes - its quality, sturdiness, and functionality. This further reinforces the favorable depiction of the Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher.\n\nFirst, the reviewer states that the potato masher is of \"great quality.\" Quality, in general, is an important factor for consumers, and by emphasizing this, the reviewer implies that they are pleased with the overall build and materials of the product. A high-quality product often implies durability and longevity, making it a wise investment for potential buyers.\n\nSecond, the reviewer highlights the sturdiness of the Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher. Sturdiness is a desirable trait for a kitchen tool, as it suggests that the product can withstand the demands of regular use without breaking or wearing out quickly. A sturdy product is likely to provide consistent results and eliminate the need for frequent replacements, offering potential customers more value for their money.\n\nLastly, the reviewer praises the potato masher for performing its intended function well, specifically mashing potatoes and turnips. This highlights the efficiency and versatility of the product. By noting that the Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher does a \"perfect job\" at its primary task, the reviewer signals that the product meets their expectations and requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer's review paints a predominantly flattering picture of the Kuhn Rikon Potato Masher. The review focuses on the product's great quality, sturdiness, and efficient functionality—all of which are desirable traits for a kitchen tool. The satisfactory experience described in the review is likely to entice potential buyers and contribute positively to the product's reputation."

The region became known as Portucale, Portugale, and simultaneously Portugália — the County of Portugal. Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Spain due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms of León, Galicia and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (León and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of León.\nAnswer:",

        "input": "The driver of the train that derailed in northwestern Spain was charged Sunday with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. At least 79 people died as a result of last week's crash. A court granted the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, conditional release. His train driver's license was suspended for six months. He must report to court weekly, and his passport was surrendered. Earlier Sunday, the driver, who was hospitalized for two days while under police guard, was transferred to court, officials said. He was in court for more than five hours. The data recorders from the train are still with police. Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening. The crash on the outskirts of the city, which is popular with tourists and Christian pilgrims, shocked the Galician region and the rest of the nation. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters Saturday there are \"rational indications\" that the accident was the fault of the driver. Pressed on what those are, he declined to provide details. 5 questions on high-speed rail. Identifying the bodies. The crumpled wreckage of the eight cars sent careering onto their sides when the train derailed has been removed from the tracks, but the grim task of identifying the dead continues. Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court, told CNN late Friday that 75 victims had been identified. At least 63 of the dead are Spanish, she said. Also among the fatalities are two U.S. citizens -- Ana-Maria Cordoba of Arlington, Virginia, and Myrta Fariza of Houston -- and some Europeans and Latin Americans. Fariza and her husband were on their way to celebrate a Catholic festival. He was injured and later released from the hospital. \"Myrta was our loving wife, mother, sister, mother-in-law, aunt and friend, and words cannot express our sense of loss,\" her family said in a statement. \"To all who knew her, Myrta provided irreplaceable love, compassion, courage, friendship and support. We will miss her dearly.\" As they are identified, most of the bodies are being returned to their families, the regional justice department said. DNA testing will be conducted on some remains to establish their identity, it said. Police forensic experts said at a news conference Saturday there are 37 body parts that must still be tested to see whether they belong to bodies that have already been identified, or to others not yet known. The death toll rose to at least 79 on Sunday morning when another person died, a representative for the regional health department said. About 70 people who were injured in the crash remained in the hospital Sunday, about 22 of them listed in serious condition, the official said. At least five U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf. Local newspaper La Voz de Galicia said that a funeral service for the victims will take place Monday evening in the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. Spain train crash victim: 'It felt like a roller coaster' Going too fast? Spanish news agency Efe and the national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was traveling about 190 kilometers per hour (about 120 mph). Elena Garcia, a spokeswoman for national railway Renfe, did not disclose Friday the speed the train was traveling on an express track, where cars can move as fast as 250 kph. But she said the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the \"tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,\" but that the reasons it was going so fast are not yet known. The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when the crash occurred, the state railway said. Security footage revealed how, as the train hurtled around a bend, its cars derailed and slammed on their sides into a concrete support structure for a bridge. Opinion: Why high-speed rail is safe, smart. Flames burst out of one train car as another car was snapped in half. Rescue crews and fellow passengers pulled bodies through broken windows and pried open doors as stunned survivors looked on. Maria Vigo, whose home is on the bank above the rail tracks, told CNN how she heard a crash, then the deafening squeal of metal on concrete. \"When I saw the rail car flip into the air, I imagined something just horrible had happened,\" she said. She and husband Suso tried to help the injured, taking bed sheets to wrap around the injured and ropes to haul the survivors off the tracks. Firefighter Miguel Angel Bello said the first four minutes after he arrived on the scene were a desperate race against time. He and fellow firefighters smashed windows and kicked in doors to pull out the passengers trapped inside as rail cars went up in flames. A young girl in the wreckage called out to him. \"She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home,\" he said. \"But she died.\" Survivor: We looked like the walking dead. Stephen Ward of Bountiful, Utah, who is in Spain serving on a Mormon religious mission, was one of the lucky ones. Still patched up and wearing a neck brace, he told CNN's New Day show of his ordeal -- and his relief that he made it out alive and without permanent injury. Ward, 18, blacked out when his car slammed on to its side, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train. It took him a couple of minutes to grasp that what he was seeing outside was not a dream -- and that people were dead. \"They were helping out other people -- there were bodies, there was screaming, there was smoke.\" The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said. \"I've got staples all over my scalp, I was covered in blood. They've scrubbed most of it off me now, but everyone was just covered in their own blood and occasionally the blood of others. It was gruesome to say the least.\" Another victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like the train was going fast. \"But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,\" he said, \"And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me.\" The derailment came on the eve of a public holiday to celebrate a saint's day, when more people than usual may have been traveling in the region. Planned festivities in Santiago de Compostela and across Galicia were canceled after the crash. CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Santiago de Compostela and Laura Perez Maestro from Galicia.

For the duration of these parts, you must do certain things in order to progress, such as exploring every area to uncover bits and pieces of the story.  You can gather information, read notes, gather food, and even find weapons if you explore properly. You are almost always required to collect all items in any given scene to progress. In certain cases, however, discovering everything is optional and not required to progress to the next part of the story. There are chances to stumble into a small event, such as eavesdropping into someone's conversation, if it pertains to the story. Do everything you think is possible, such as give the food you find to your allies or sit next to them and talk. Eventually, you will hear more of their side and gain objectives for your next mission. Using Lee, you have the option to come off as strongly to one side, strongly to the other, or neutral. This is affected by the choices that you make, in addition to affecting your relationship with Clementine.  Whether or not Clementine is your Lee's first priority is your decision. Every decision you make may or may not hold consequences, so take care if you don't want somebody to be unhappy with you. Choose what you believe is right, then move on. This game is tailored to your choices. Though the first season always has the same ending, how you get there is entirely up to you. There really is no right or wrong choice in this game. The game's setting presents a moral grey area, so be confident in the choices that you make.\n\nSummary:",
